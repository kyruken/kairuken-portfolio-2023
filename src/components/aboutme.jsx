                        At a young age, Iâ€™ve always appreciated the idea of enhancing my skills at whatever I pursued. 
                        I stumbled upon web development, and I fell in love with the creative aspects and technical application. 
                        Web development has enough complexity to keep me intrigued at every corner, but it also allows me to have creative input into what I would like to build. 
                        As a lifelong learner and believer of a growth mindset, I will constantly be improving my coding abilities in order to become a better programmer each day.
